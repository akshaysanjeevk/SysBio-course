1. Starting from RegulonDB, create the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) of E. coli as a directed graph. 

2. Compute the basic statistics of the constructed TRN.

3. Compute the occurrences of the different 3-node circuits in the constructed TRN, followed by computation of 3-node network motifs.

4. Write a code to perform vertex-sort based hierarchical decomposition of the constructed TRN.

5. Visualize the hierarchical decomposition of the TRN in Cytoscape.
